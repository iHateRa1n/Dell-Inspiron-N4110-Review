# Dell Inspiron N4110 Review

I just got the Dell Inspiron N4110 laptop, and I love it.

TL;DR: If you need a cheap laptop, I recommend it.

# DISCLAIMER

I recieved this product for free, as a present from work.

THE OPINIONS PRESENTED ARE MY OWN.

# Specs

It has an Intel Core i3 2350M @ 2.3GHz, which runs pretty well.

The in-built graphics are decent if you want to play basic games; it passed the Minecraft test just fine.

6GB of DDR3 RAM @ 1333 MHz (if only it was 1337 am I right? lol)

And a 500GB hard drive.

# Actual Review

The unit I got was used in a business, and it doesn't have a functional battery, so I had to keep it plugged in, ALL THE TIME.

It's decently fast, and is suprisingly usuable.

So I'm going to buy a new battery, and it should be very usable after that.

I'm writing this review on the laptop, and it's working well.

In fact, it's the only computer I own that can actually play YouTube in 720P; while getting 60 FPS.

That's actually kind of sad.

# Conclusion

Is it something I recommend?

Yes.

Is it decent in any way?

Yes.

Is it usable for $125 on eBay?

Yes.

Is it something that I am going to be using for a while?

Yes!

Now, is that all of your questions? Good, because I want to keep using it.







Thanks for reading, bye!
